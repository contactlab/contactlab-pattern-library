#Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

The `master` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the `develop` branch.

Each time you want to work on a fix or a new feature, create a new `branch` based on the develop branch: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop`. Only pull requests to the `develop` branch will be merged.
