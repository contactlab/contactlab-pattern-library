					<h2>Using with other frameworks / libraries</h2>
					<p>Web Components built with Polymer behaves like normal HTML tags and can be used in new or existing projects regardless the JavaScript framework or library in use.
						<br>Here are some example and advice for having the Contactlab Pattern Library components working with the most common frontend solutions.</p>
					<hr>

					<h3 id="vanilla">(vanilla) Javascript</h3>
					<p>This is the most simple case of use, just use any JavaScript DOM selector to get the element (like <code>querySelector()</code> ,
						<code>getElementByID()</code> , ecc.. ) and then you have access to all of the properties and methos described in the documentation.</p>

					<h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3>
					<p>When accessing a DOM element using jQuery selector ( <code>$('selector')</code> ) it will become wrapped inside the <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/jquery-object/" target="_blank">jQuery Object</a>, which makes easy to work with
						all of the jQuery methods but since that is <strong>not</strong> a standard JavaScript API all native methods and properties of the component are not available. <br> You can still
						"extract" the element from the jQuery Object since its basically an extended array, using the array index syntax: </p>
					<gist-embed user="clab-gist" uuid="da6659e3b9b5f48df868ed2510e01367"></gist-embed>
					<p>On the other hand, by "extracting" the element from the jQuery Object you lose the access to the jQuery methods... so maybe it will be useful to work with
						vanilla Javascript :) .</p>

					<h3 id="react">React</h3>
					<p>As <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/webcomponents.html" target="_blank">the official documentation points out</a>, React
						and Web Components can be complimentary technologies. Since the latest version of React you can just add the component you need
						inside your JSX file to see it rendered and working as HTML element, if you need (as in most of the cases) to have the component
						to interact with React for data-bind to attributes and listen events you will need the
						<a href="https://github.com/jscissr/react-polymer" target="_blank">rect-polymer</a> NPM module to bridge between the different data models,
						and then you can have a full integration like this</p>
